This project provides a working example project using the MGSplitViewController class in a three20 project.

Notes
-----
- This project is universal app. The SplitViewController is displayed only for ipad, while the app works normally on iphone devices.
- The split view doesn't support TTNavigator links (tt://) now. Controllers have to be pushed and poped using the standard ios sdk.
- The SplitViewController allows you to have a master controller (left controller), which is the navigator for the details controller (right controller).
- Orientation changes are fully supported 
- The MGSplitViewController emulates the behavior of the standard UISplitViewController
- The code provides without any warranty
