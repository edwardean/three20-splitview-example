======

This project provides a working example project of TTSplitViewController & UISplitViewController controllers. I found the standard TTSplitViewController a little buggy.

Notes
-----
- This project requires the release branch from my three20 fork (https://github.com/aporat/three20/tree/release). This branch includes changes to the TTSplitViewController and additions to UICommon classes. The project won't compile with the standard three20. 
- This project is universal app. The TTSplitViewController is displayed only for ipad, while the app works normally on iphone devices.
- The TTSplitViewController allows you to have a primary controller, which is a TTTableViewController that manage the details controller.
- Orientation changes are fully supported and the example project behaves like the standard UISplitViewController
- This code provides without any warranty
